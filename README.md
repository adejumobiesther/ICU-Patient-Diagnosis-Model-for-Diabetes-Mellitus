# ICU-Patient-Diagnosis-Model-for-Diabetes-Mellitus

This project is my submission for the "WiDS Datathon 2021" competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/widsdatathon2021). The competition focused on developing models to determine whether a patient admitted to an ICU has been diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus, using data from the first 24 hours of intensive care.

## Goal

The goal of this project was to develop an accurate prediction model for Diabetes Mellitus diagnosis in ICU patients, using machine learning algorithms and techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset provided for the competition contained labeled training data for model development, as well as unlabeled data for final prediction. The data included various demographic, clinical, and laboratory features for ICU patients.

## Approach

My approach to this project involved exploring the dataset, conducting data preprocessing and feature engineering, and experimenting with various machine learning algorithms and techniques. After training and fine-tuning several models, I selected the best-performing model for final submission.

## Results

My prediction model achieved a top 30% rank on the public leaderboard, indicating its effectiveness in predicting Diabetes Mellitus diagnosis in ICU patients.

## Usage

To run this project, you will need to download the dataset provided by the competition organizers and execute the Python code provided in the Jupyter notebook file.

## Credits

I would like to thank the competition organizers and Kaggle community for providing this opportunity to develop my skills and knowledge in machine learning and data science. 

Please feel free to contact me for any questions or feedback on this project.
